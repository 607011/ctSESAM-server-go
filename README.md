= c't SESAM Storage Server

This is a rewrite of the [c't SESAM server](https://github.com/ola-ct/ctSESAM-server). It's now written in Go instead of PHP.

_c't SESAM Storage Server_ is a data store for [c't SESAM](https://github.com/ola-ct/Qt-SESAM). It's supposed to be installed on a server and used by only you or a small community (your family, close friends).
